# trivia-flashcard-app
a dynamic flashcard app using React... but ~make it pink~

I followed along with this tutorial:

I then wanted to change the colors to make it pop.

It implements dynamic sizing in terms of how many cards are shown and card height is dynamic based upon the length of the question.

I really enjoyed making the cards "flip."

Next goal is to trade out this API for a different one with wine trivia/info and modify the form at the top to choose either different categories or none.
