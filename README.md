# trivia-flashcard-app
a dynamic flashcard app using React but make it pink.

I followed along with this tutorial:

I then wanted to change the colors to make it pop.

Implements dynamic sizing of the screen and the number of cards, card height is dynamic based on the length of the question.

And I really enjoyed making the cards "flip"

Next goal is to trade out this API for a different one with wine trivia/infor and modify the form at the top to choose either different categories or none.
